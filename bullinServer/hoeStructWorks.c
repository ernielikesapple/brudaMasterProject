// Pointers can be used to refer to a struct by its address. This is useful for passing structs to a function. The pointer can be dereferenced using the * operator. The -> operator dereferences the pointer to struct (left operand) and then accesses the value of a member of the struct (right operand).
struct point {
   int x;
   int y;
};
struct point my_point = { 3, 7 };
struct point *p = &my_point;  // p is a pointer to my_point

void sFunc() {
    (*p).x = 8;                   /* set the first member of the struct */
    p->x = 8;
    // scanf("%d", &p -> x);
}

                 // set the first member of the struct
//p->x = 8;
